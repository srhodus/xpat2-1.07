Bits  0- 8: srcind  9 bit, 0-511
Bits  9-14: dstpile 6 bit, 0- 63
Bit     15: move turned a card in a slot
Bit  16-31: same for inverse move

NO_MOVE:	0xffffffffUL
new cards:	0xffff8000UL + number of cards (0-63)
begin compound:	0xffff9000UL
end compound:	0xffff9001UL

impossible combinations:
Both bit 31 and bit 15 set (=> new cards)
srcpile and dstpile have same index => rotate slot
