Changes from xpat2-0.91 to xpat2-0.92
-------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in X-gfx2.c: tried to read Cards.conf if open failed.
  Thanks to Mitch DSouza <m.dsouza@mrc-apu.cam.ac.uk> for pointing this out.
- changed the default behaviour of the Seahaven rules to conform to the
  "official" Seahaven rules. The relaxed variant of the previous xpat versions
  may be played by 'xpat2 -rules Seahaven -p0 1'


Changes from xpat2-0.92 to xpat2-1.00
-------------------------------------
- changed the version number ;-)
  added manual


Changes from xpat2-1.00 to xpat2-1.03

  the unused 'commands' resource of the Tableau widget
- removed #ifdef DEBUGGING's in Xaw-main.c and Xm-main.c

  lacked a trailing NULL

Changes from xpat2-1.03 to xpat2-1.04

Changes from xpat2-1.04 to xpat2-1.05 (released 4-Apr-1996)
-----------------------------------------------------------
- removed a bug in X-gfx2.c which made it impossible to use
  absolute directories as argument to the -xpmdir option.
- new rules: Oonsoo


Changes from xpat2-1.05 to xpat2-1.06
-------------------------------------
- The BlueMoon rule set was added by Willem Monsuwe
- FreeCell rules are smarter now when moving cards and slots are free
- Cardbacks are loaded later, have a fallback Cardback when loading
  of a one with too much colors fails
- new Cardback: Tux, the Linux penguin,
  antialiased X-logo background
- new xpm directory 'fallback', with images using less colours
- more code moved from X-*.c into UI-independent files
- minor improvements for the Motif/Lesstif UI, renamed useMotif to
  useXm (libXm.a is the common name of the library for Motif and LessTif)
- started work on the Qt widget user interface, will perhaps later support
  KDE, despite I think it's too much Windooze-like
- incorporated the patches from the Debian distribution
- added loading of cardsets for monochrome servers from X-gfx1 into X-gfx2
- improved handling of the LANG environment variable
  (access checking, handling of ISO3166 codes, and possible fallbacks to
  the English language in case the given LANG value fails)
- new sound module X-sound_NAS.c, using the NAS network audio system.
  (useful when you're on an X-Terminal with no local /dev/audio).
  Attention: this requires the installation of the (free) NAS server.
- script for incorporating cardsets from pysol.
  pysol can be found at ftp://ftp.metalab.unc.de/pub/Linux/games/solitaire
