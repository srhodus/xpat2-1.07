===================================

- MinWindow, PreferredWindow may give correct results after the second
  time, since the height of the buttonbox may vary. In certain cases
  (Calculation) the layout can change with the PreferredWindow command.
- implement logfile locking (minor priority)
- set default help to current rule set
- Calculation: always the last cards are used for the start of the stacks
- cheat detect for Canfield, Calculation, and Royal Cotillion
- nicer and more complete texts for online help.
- draw something different for an empty pile
- welcome message in Xlib doesn't appear
- expose bug: if there is only a small amount of memory for the X-server,
  some parts of the window may be blank and the user has to hit 'ctrl-L'
  to get the complete window.
