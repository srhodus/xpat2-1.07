Since xpat2 1.00, there is a better distinction between the game logic and the
graphics interface. This should make porting to other platforms easier.
Porting is encouraged by the authors. We would like to incorporate your port
into the standard distribution, provided it uses strict ANSI C prototyping.
and does not contain machine dependent #ifdef's which can be avoided.
All ports must be distributed as freeware, the sources must be made available
to everyone.
Source files independent of any graphic interface have names that start with
lower case letters and do not contain a minus sign in their name.
This means, for example, that the files [^X]*.[ch] are completely
independent of the choosen interface, but X-*.[ch] may contain
dependencies.
These files include "xpatgame.h", which includes "xpat.h".
A subset of the above are files whose name is starting with "r_". They
implement a certain ruleset.

All source code of the above modules does require nothing except ANSI-C.
POSIX.1 is fine, but not required.

Filenames that start with uppercase letters are interface-dependent.
The specification of the interface is followed by a minus sign.
They include their interface-specific header. For all X11 implementations,
this is "X-pat.h", which itself includes "xpat.h".

The current filenames follow this naming convention:

X-*:	common to all X11 interfaces
Xlib-*:	Xlib interface
Xaw-*:	Athena Widgets interface
Xm-*:	Motif interface		(anyone to make it work?)
Xv-*:	Xview interface
Xol-*:	Open Look interface	(Planned. Any volunteers?)
XQt*:   Qt widgets (C++)	(not finished yet, ugly code!)

All filenames in the src subdirectory have a maximum length of 14 characters
and consist only of the mimimum character set defined by POSIX.1
All files in the lib subdirectory also follow this restriction. (Caused by
this, some help files have cryptic names.)

Ports to other operating systems should perhaps use the following prefixes:
PM-*:	OS/2 presentation manager interface
NT-*:	Windows/NT interface
MAC-*:	Macintosh interface
etc. (Just in case someone wants it. The authors stick to UNIX / X-windows)
