This is the source for the utilities to generate nice
suit symbols. Generate your favourite bitmaps for the rank
and suit symbols in some new subdirectory of makecards, copy
config.h there (to possibly change the ``white''-colour to
grey or anything you like). Then compile rank and run it.
rename rank to suit and run it.
In Suit.xpm, change the ``white'' colour (#FFFFFFFFFFFF) to ``None''.
You may do this for Rank.xpm also.

  Have fun

combine will collect {Jack|Queen|King}.(suit).pic.xpm pictures
(WHICH MUST HAVE THE SAME SIZE)
and combine them to ``Pictures.xpm'' or the other way round.
This saves time during xpat2 startup.
