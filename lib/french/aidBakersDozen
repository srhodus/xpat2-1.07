	The Rules of Baker's Dozen
	==========================

You have 13 piles of 4 cards each, in which kings are
if necessary moved to the last position. Your goal is
to put all cards on the foundation, in order A-K.  you
are allowed to move all cards at top of piles (and of
top of foundation) on a pile where the last card is
one more than the moved one, or to the foundation (so
a 5 of hearts could go under any six, or above the 4
of hearts in the foundation). Holes cannot be filled
(this is why kings are put on bottom of piles, as they
can be moved only on foundations). I like it because
it's rather quick, has a decent probability of success
and it's not automatic.

Baker's Dozen may be customized by changing the number
of slots (in the range 2..13). With fewer slots, the
cards of lower rank are already moved to the stack,
which makes the game easier.
