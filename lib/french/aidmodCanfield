	The Rules of modified Canfield
	==============================

These are the rules of Canfield, with the exception that
card sequences may NOT wrap on the slots (i.e. King upon
an Ace), and the hand and the stock are the same pile.
This variant is considerably easier than the original
Canfield game.
