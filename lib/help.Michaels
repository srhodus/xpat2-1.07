	The Rules of Michael's Fantasy
	==============================

This variant was invented to test the slot rotation
commands of xpat2. Michael's Fantasy is played with
one deck of 52 cards.  The game is similar to Free
Cell, but you have only 6 slots, and 3-4 cards are
initially dealt facedown. To compensate this, you may
rotate slots up to five times (visible cards only).
To do this, press the 'b' or 'f' (for backward or
forward) key and then click on the lowest card to
move.
