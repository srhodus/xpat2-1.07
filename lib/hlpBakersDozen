	The Rules of Baker's Dozen
	==========================

You have 13 piles of 4 cards each, in which Kings are,
if necessary, moved to the last position. The goal is to
put all cards on the foundation, in order Ace to King.
You are allowed to move all cards from the top of the
piles (and from the top of the foundations) onto a pile
where the last card is one more than the moved one, or
onto the foundations (so a 5 of hearts could go under
any six, or above the 4 of hearts in the
foundation). Holes cannot be filled (this is why Kings
are put on bottom of the piles, as they can be moved
only onto the foundations). I like it, because it's
rather quick, has a decent probability of success, and
it's not automatic.

Baker's Dozen may be customized by changing the number
of slots (in the range 2..13). With fewer slots, the
cards of lower rank are already moved to the stack,
which makes the game easier.
