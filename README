README for xpat2-1.07
=====================


0) Changing Imakefile:
======================

If you are going to install xpat2 in your home directory, you
have to change XPATLIBDIR and SCOREFILE in src/Imakefile.
This can be done by typing 'patch < diff.noroot'
If you don't have the xpm library, type 'patch < diff.noxpm'.
You may also customize other options by editing src/Imakefile
by hand, if you know what you do.

Please note that src/Imakefile may be overwritten by
src/Imakefile.none if you type 'make allinterfaces', which
compiles several xpat binaries (for different widget sets).


1) Compiling:
=============

On a system properly set up, you may type 'make' to build the
binary src/xpat2 from scratch.
(Tested on PCs with Linux, HPs with HP-UX 9, SUNs, and RS/6000.)
With the default configuration, you need imake, the Athena
widget set, the Xmu library, and the Xpm library.
By default, HPs don't have anything of this, you (or your system
administrator) have to supply it. On SUNs, the GNU C-compiler is
used.
If you want to change the configuration, change the Imakefile
in the src/ subdirectory BEFORE you type 'make'

'make' from this level will do a 'make clean' first. If you
want to continue an interrupted run of make, type 'make' in
the src/ subdirectory.


2) Installing:
==============

Afterwards, type 'make install' (as root) to install the game
in default directories.
'make install' will copy a manual page into /usr/man/man6.
You can change this path in the file src/Imakefile.
The man-page doesn't explain everything. The 'make' run will
provide you with a manual in DVI and Postscript form in the doc
subdirectory, with is more complete.

For Linux machines, you may want to do 'make install.fsstnd' instead,
which differs from 'make install' only by the directory where the
binary is installed. With install.fsstnd, it is /usr/games/bin, which
conforms to the Linux Filesystem Standard.

If you are not root and want to install xpat2 in your home directory,
do 'make install.local'. Again, the default paths are defined in
src/Imakefile and you may change them. The default directory for the
binary is $(HOME)/bin in this case.



       Have fun
